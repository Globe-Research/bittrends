    \section{Introduction}
    Trend following is one of the highest capacity investment strategies of the last hundred years, with the managed futures industry managing \$325bn of investor money.
    Returns in commodities markets have become less impressive over the last decade.
    Digital asset markets (cryptocurrencies) bear many of the features of commodities markets during the heyday of trend following.
    This study will develop quantitative trend following strategies in cryptocurrency markets and compare against traditional markets.
    
    Firstly impelemtnign vanilla trend following, and optomise hyper paremeters and determine the fit to digital asset markets.

    Extension, determine features that are relevant and are the most important influencing factors for this model.
